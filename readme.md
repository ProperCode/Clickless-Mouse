# ClickLess Mouse

This program is for disabled people.<br/>
ClickLess Mouse makes using computer easier for people with repetitive strain injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, 
some motor disabilities and other health problems.

This application allows to use mouse without clicking - by moving it only.<br/>
It simulates left/right mouse click, double left mouse click and mouse button holding by moving mouse.<br/>
It can be used with Free Virtual Keyboard to type by moving mouse (https://freevirtualkeyboard.com/).

When you want to click/hold mouse button: stop moving mouse, wait for squares to appear and move mouse cursor to the chosen square:
- Top square is for double left mouse button click
- Top left square = left mouse button click
- Top right square = right mouse button click
- Left square = left mouse button hold ON/OFF
- Right square = right mouse button hold ON/OFF

When mouse cursor is located inside a square long enough (depending on hover time to register click setting), it automatically moves
back to previous position to simulate action based on square that was previously entered.

If mouse cursor is too close to top edge of the screen, squares for LMB, RMB and double LMB are shown below mouse cursor.

Squares that aren't needed can be disabled.
